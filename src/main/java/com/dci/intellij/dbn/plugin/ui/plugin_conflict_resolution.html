PLUGIN CONFLICT<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Database Navigator</b> - third party</li>
    <li><b>Database Tools and SQL</b> - JetBrains standard distribution</li>
</ul>
Both <u>Database Navigator</u> (DBN) and
the <u>Database Tools and SQL</u> plugins, provide very similar database functionality.
Having both plugins installed, can lead to ambiguous and at times conflicting user experience. <u>You are advised to disable one of them.</u><br><br>

<u>Database Navigator</u> is NOT a complementary product to (nor is ist integrated with) the standard distribution database support.
It offers only few additional features and a slightly different user experience, while being less integrated with the other IDE features and language support.
