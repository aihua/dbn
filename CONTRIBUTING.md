# Contributing to this repository
Your contributions are welcome and appreciated! There are multiple ways to contribute to this project

## Reporting issues
For defects or feature requests, please file a JIRA ticket under [DBN Issue Tracking Repository](https://database-navigator.atlassian.net)

Repository areas: 
 - DBN (DBN Main) - Main repository for defects and feature requests
 - DBNE (DBN Exceptions) - Repository for exceptions reported from within the IDE (using built-in error submission feature)
 - DBNB (DBN Backlog) - Old deprecated or outdated requests subject of review (reconsideration or closure)

When filing a bug, remember that the more detailed the bug is described,
the more likely it is to be reproduced and fixed. The same applies to usability issues and feature requirements.

Environment details (like OS name and version, IDE version, Plugin build no.) are always welcome and valuable in identifying or isolating a given defect or misbehavior.
